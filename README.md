# Coffee Shop

This is an SPA ecommerce site for a store that sells coffee.  It consists of three main sections: Home (a landing page with an about message), Shop (a searchable list of products), and Admin Portal.  The Admin Portal initially displays a login screen.  Once logged in, it redirects to a form to add products to the site.  Clicking on a product on the Shop page will display a product information page.  If you are logged in, there will be an Edit button on the product information page, which will allow you to edit the product.
